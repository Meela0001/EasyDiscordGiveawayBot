# EasyDiscordGiveawayBot
A EZ discord giveaway bot

This bot listens for messages that start with the /start, /end, /reroll, and /enter commands. When the /start command is used, the bot starts a giveaway and sets the end time and message ID. When the /end command is used, the bot picks a random winner from the list of entries and announces the winner in the giveaway message. When the /reroll command is used, the bot picks a new winner without ending the giveaway. When someone uses the /enter command, the bot adds them to the list of entries if the giveaway is still ongoing.

I wrote this because i was board and had nothing to do. (:
